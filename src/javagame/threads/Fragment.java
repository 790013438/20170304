 PITFALL.
String Index Out of Bounds
If an index supplied to any String, StringBuilder, or StringBuffer method is outside
the valid range of character positions for the string object (i.e., if the index is less than 0
or greater than or equal to the string length), a StringIndexOutOfBounds‐Exception will
occur. This is a run‐time error and will terminate program execution. We will discuss
exceptions in more detail in Section A.11.
