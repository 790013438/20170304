//This bounding box determines if the object is outside the bounds of the screen and needs to be wrapped to the other side.  The PolygonWrapper class, located in the javagames.prototype package, contains methods to wrap polygons and positions. The constructor takes the width and height of the screen in world coordinates and computes the minimum and maximum vector values.  The hasLeftWorld() method checks the given position against the minimum and maximum world coordinates. The wrapPosition() method returns a wrapped position if the given position has left the bounds of the world. The wrapped position is adjusted by the width and height of the world so the new position is never outside the bounds of the world. The bounds of the polygon to be wrapped are computed as follows
