//The operator % in the condition (nextInt % 2 == 0) gives the remainder after an integer division, so the condition is true if nextInt is an even number. If maxVal has been defined, the following loops (for loop on the left, while loop on the right) store the sum of the even integers from 1 to maxVal in variable sum (initial value 0), and they store the product of the odd integers in variable prod (initial value 1).
